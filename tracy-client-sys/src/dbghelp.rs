//! On Windows, both Tracy and Rust use the `dbghelp.dll` symbol helper to resolve symbols for stack traces.
//! `dbghelp.dll` is single threaded and requires synchronization to call any of its functions.
//!
//! The Rust standard library includes the `backtrace-rs` crate for capturing and resolving backtraces.
//! When both the standard library and the `backtrace-rs` crate are used in the same program
//! they need to synchronize their access to `dbghelp.dll`.
//! They use a shared named Windows mutex for that, which we will use as well.
//!
//! Users of Tracy (like this crate) can define the `TRACY_DBGHELP_LOCK` variable for synchronizing access to `dbghelp.dll`.
//! We set `TRACY_DBGHELP_LOCK=RustBacktraceMutex` in the build script.
//! Tracy will call [`RustBacktraceMutexInit`], [`RustBacktraceMutexLock`], and [`RustBacktraceMutexUnlock`].
//! In those functions a handle to the shared named mutex is created, the mutex is locked, and unlocked respectively.
//!
//! There is also an issue with initialization between Tracy and `backtrace-rs`.
//! In particular, the `SymInitialize` function should only be called once per process
//! and will return an error on subsequent calls.
//! Both Tracy and `backtrace-rs` ignore errors of the `SymInitialize` function,
//! so calling it multiple times is not an issue.
//! But `backtrace-rs` adds `SYMOPT_DEFERRED_LOADS` to the symbol options before initialization,
//! and adds the directory of all loaded modules (executable and DLLs) to the symbol search path.
//! That causes the symbols for Rust modules to be found even when the working directory isn't the Cargo target directory.
//! Tracy doesn't add the `SYMOPT_DEFERRED_LOADS` option and manually loads all modules.
//! Note that changing the symbol search path doesn't affect modules that were already loaded.
//!
//! Therefore, we want `backtrace-rs` to initialize and modify the symbol search path before Tracy.
//! To do that, a standard library backtrace is captured and resolved in [`RustBacktraceMutexInit`].
